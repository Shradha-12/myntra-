## Inspiration
Meet Zoe, a spirited 22-year-old college student with a love for fashion. Living in a bustling urban city, Zoe is always on top of the latest trends. However, she faces a challenge many fashion enthusiasts can relate to: managing a vast wardrobe while staying fashionable and sustainable. Zoe inspired us to create a solution that brings order to the chaos and fun to fashion collaboration.

## Problem Faced
1. **Wardrobe Chaos**: Many of us have closets overflowing with clothes, making it tough to find the perfect outfit quickly.
2. **Decision Fatigue**: Too many choices can be overwhelming, turning the simple task of picking an outfit into a stressful decision.
3. **Trend Anxiety**: Keeping up with the latest trends can feel like a never-ending race, especially if you don't want to keep buying new clothes.
4. **Collaboration Crave**: Sharing fashion ideas with friends is fun, but without a dedicated platform, it can be tricky and inefficient.

## Solution
Introducing Myntra's My Wardrobe, your ultimate fashion management and collaboration tool. It's not just about organizing your clothes—it's about transforming your fashion experience into something magical, social, and effortlessly stylish.


### Key Features
1. **Wardrobe Capsules**: Create and name your wardrobe capsules, categorize your items, and access them easily. Imagine having a ‘Party Wear’ capsule next to a ‘Gym Gear’ one, each tailored to your unique style.
2. **Social Sharing**: Share your curated wardrobes on Myntra Minis and other social media platforms. Inspire others and get inspired by the fashion community.
3. **Blended Wardrobes**: Use the 'Blend Wardrobe' feature to combine your wardrobe with friends. Mix and match outfits to create stunning new looks together.
4. **Fashion Similarity Score**: Discover how your fashion choices align with your friends’. Make fashion a fun, social activity by seeing how well your styles mesh.

 ## Implementation
Firstly, the Ultimate User graph for each user is made by mapping their fashion preferences, wardrobe choices, searches, purchases and other app interactions internally to metadata tags. The graph utilises these metadata tags as graph nodes, while the edge weights are calculated based on user's affinity for products of each metadata type.We would highly urge you to checkout our [complete pitch deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jx8SZ29iNiPXzBeavMATckn7_L-EEtNB/view?usp=drive_link) to understand all the components of the solution and its implementation.
