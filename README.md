## Inspiration
Meet Zoe, a spirited 22-year-old college student with a love for fashion. Living in a bustling urban city, Zoe is always on top of the latest trends. However, she faces a challenge many fashion enthusiasts can relate to: managing a vast wardrobe while staying fashionable and sustainable. Zoe inspired us to create a solution that brings order to the chaos and fun to fashion collaboration.

## Problem Faced
1. **Wardrobe Chaos**: Many of us have closets overflowing with clothes, making it tough to find the perfect outfit quickly.
2. **Decision Fatigue**: Too many choices can be overwhelming, turning the simple task of picking an outfit into a stressful decision.
3. **Trend Anxiety**: Keeping up with the latest trends can feel like a never-ending race, especially if you don't want to keep buying new clothes.
4. **Collaboration Crave**: Sharing fashion ideas with friends is fun, but without a dedicated platform, it can be tricky and inefficient.

## Solution
Introducing Myntra's My Wardrobe, your ultimate fashion management and collaboration tool. It's not just about organizing your clothes—it's about transforming your fashion experience into something magical, social, and effortlessly stylish.

I would highly urge you to checkout our [complete pitch deck](./ .pdf) to understand all the componenets of the solution and it's implementation.
